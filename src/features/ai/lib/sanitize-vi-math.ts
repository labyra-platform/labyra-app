/**
 * Strip `$` / `$$` math delimiters around spans that contain Vietnamese letters.
 * @phase R240
 *
 * The model occasionally wraps Vietnamese prose inside math mode, e.g.
 * "$tức là vẽ đồ thị (αhν)^{1/2}$". remarkMath then treats it as math and
 * rehypeKatex renders it as smooshed italic with missing glyphs ("No character
 * metrics for 'ứ'"), which is unreadable.
 *
 * This runs on the raw markdown STRING before react-markdown. The previous
 * approach (remark-unwrap-vi-math, a mdast transformer) is a no-op under
 * react-markdown v10 — its in-place node mutation is not applied in that
 * pipeline — so the guard silently stopped working. A string pre-pass is
 * independent of react-markdown internals and cannot regress on upgrade.
 *
 * Heuristic (same as the old plugin): a math span whose content carries a
 * Vietnamese diacritic is prose, not math. Valid LaTeX/math uses ASCII +
 * symbols only, so an accented Latin letter is a reliable prose signal.
 * Genuine math ($\theta$, $E_g$, $d=\lambda/2\sin\theta$) is left untouched.
